This program defines a Tower struct to store the tower's coordinates and quality factor. The calculateDistance function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. The getNetworkQuality function iterates over all possible coordinates within the radius, calculates the network quality at each coordinate, and keeps track of the maximum quality and its corresponding coordinates.

In the main function, you can modify the towers array, the numTowers, and the radius variables according to your needs. The program then calls the getNetworkQuality function and prints the maximum network quality and the corresponding coordinates.

Please note that the program assumes the C99 standard or above for the use of variable-length arrays. If you're using an older C standard, you may need to modify the program to allocate memory dynamically for the towers array.
